# The disorganisers

*José, Charles, and Jean will be the trouble makers in chief during the unconference. Remember: whatever happens is this only thing that could have. Is it a promise or is it a threat?*

## Grand Chambellan ##

José Paumard started working with the Java platform when it was released about 25 years ago.

## Mr president ##

Charles Sabourdin is Architect Freelancer. Mostly focus on Java, Linux and Kubernetes with a drop of Security. Charles is all about community. Firstly, involve in [Paris Linux User Group](https://parinux.org), he joined [Paris Java User Group](https://www.parisjug.org) at its very beginning and took care of the recording, editing and delivering of the video and, believe me, that was not that simple 10 years ago. He has been ParisJUG’s Leader for some time. He often speaks at technical conferences and meetup.

## Just Jean ##
