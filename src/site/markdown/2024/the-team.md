*José, Charles, and Jean will be the trouble makers in chief during the unconference. Remember: whatever happens is this only thing that could have. Is it a promise or is it a threat?*

## Grand Chambellan

José Paumard started working with the Java platform when it was released about 25 years ago.

## Mr president

Charles Sabourdin is Architect Freelancer. Mostly focus on Java, Linux and Kubernetes with a drop of Security. Charles is all about community. Firstly, involve in [Paris Linux User Group](https://parinux.org), he joined [Paris Java User Group](https://www.parisjug.org) at its very beginning and took care of the recording, editing and delivering of the video and, believe me, that was not that simple 10 years ago.

## Just Jean
