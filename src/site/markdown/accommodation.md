JChateau® has been held in the [Relais des trois châteaux](https://www.relaisdestroischateaux.com/) for 4 years now. The [Relais des trois châteaux](https://www.relaisdestroischateaux.com/) is a very nice hotel and conference center, built in an old, fully restored 18th century building conveniently located less than 20 minutes drive from the most beautiful castles of the Loire Valley: Blois, Chambord, and some others. Cheverny is within walking distance. This is in the middle of the Châteaux of the Loire Valley, designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000.

The [Relais des trois chateaux](https://www.relaisdestroischateaux.com/) hotel has been created in an ancient building in the middle of the Cour-Cheverny village.
