## JChateau

JChateau® is an **Unconference** happening in France in the touristic area known as "Châteaux de la Loire".

The purpose of this unconference is to bring together people interested in Crafting Java Technologies.

JChateau® is fully inspired by [JCrete](http://www.jcrete.org/), [JAlba](https://jalba.scot/) and [SoCraTes](https://socrates-fr.github.io/).

Our unconference will take place in a hotel in order to have morning sessions on self appointed subjects and free time in the afternoon to visit many historical jewels in the area (Chambord Castle, Da Vinci's Workshop, ... ).
