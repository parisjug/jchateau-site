## Registration web site

You can register now for JChateau! The number of places is very limited, so do not wait: register today!

JChateau is a family-friendly event, if you plan to come with your family, or your friends, and need special accommodation, please contact us so that we can arrange things.

The hotel has special rooms for people with disabilities, please contact us if you need any specific assistance.

__You can register here, but...__

All the rooms available at the JChateau hotel are currently booked. So unless you have been instructed to register on this page, please don't do it, because we will have to cancel your order and refund you. 

You can still register with limited accommodation [here](registrationinfo.md).
