## Registration web site

You can register now for JChateau! The number of places is very limited, so do not wait: register today!

JChateau is a family friendly event, if you plan to come with your family, or your friends, and need special accommodation, please contact us so that we can arrange things.

The hotel has special rooms for people with disabilities, please contact us if you need any specific assistance.

__The registration is open, but...__

Sorry but all the rooms available at the JChateau hotel are booked. If you absolutely want to come, you can still register, but only with lunches and dinners, meaning that you will need to find another place to stay for the night.

You can also register on our wait list, so that we can inform you if any spot becomes available.
