You can check the exact location of the hotel on [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/TNH8XL14ciDEovxd8).

## Car pooling

Some participants are coming by car from Paris, and have available seats. Carpooling worked great the previous years: no one was lost, and it's a great opportunity to start the conversations before the start of the unconference. It's very convenient, especially if you are coming from abroad. 

We share the available cars and seats a few days before the start of the event, so do not forget to check the messages we send you.
